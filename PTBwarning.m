% PTB-INFO: There are still 483 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
% PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
% PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
% PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
% PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
% PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
% PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)
